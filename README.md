TL - Never touch grass. (yes that is the official slogan)

TL is my first successful programming language, built on Python. It's loosely based on Python, but with enchanced syntax. For example, loops:
In python, you type "for i in range(<number>):". That is wordy. What would be better is "repeat <number> | ". Less finger straining.

To do list:
• Error handling
• Functions
• Lists
